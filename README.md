This is a basic web application where you can quiz yourself on Hiragana characters. 

First, learn the pronunciation and association for every hiragana character, and then try to quiz yourself. If you get it right, then the pronunciation is played, but if you get it wrong, the card
containing the character turns red. You can try until you get it right.
